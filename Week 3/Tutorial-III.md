# Tutorial-III

## Crystals
1.  Find the cube's four 3-fold axes of symmetry.

2. Find the planes of symmetry of a Rhombohedron. (see figure 1)

## Molecules
3. Show the plane of symmetry for grain alcohol i.e. $C_2 H_5 OH$. See figure 2 for a visualization. The Marshmallow represents the carbon atom, the black olives represent the hydrogen atoms, they Cherry represents the Methane ion and the green olive represents the OH ion.

## Life and symmetries
4. What could be the reason for the handedness of the Amino acids that are components of DNA?

## Higher dimensional spaces
5. Find out how to visualize a tesseract.

## Kepler's law
6. Prove Kepler's third law for circular orbits and argue why it must be true for eliptical orbits. ||Hint: use Newton's laws||
