# Symmetry in poetry

We will now perform a short excursion into the world of poetry and examine the various ways in which reflection symmetry manifests.

# Written poetry

## Shape of the poem

One manifestation of reflection symmetry in poetry comes in the form of the entire layout/shape of the verse being reflection symmetric. Such poems have been found to even date back to 300 BC in ancient Greece.

Another example which pays homage to the “axe poem” would be George Herbert’s **Easter Wings**

Another great example of this would be the poem, “Mirror” by Rita Dove where the arrangement of words are used to embody a symmetric shape. Moreover, the author employs a mirrored arrangement of words to express the sensation of resting her feelings upon her reflection.

## Rhyme

The ways words rhyme is often termed a “rhyme scheme”. Authors often employ symmetrical rhyme-schemes as it is most explicit in the poem Tyger Tyger” by William blake. The poem features a AABB rhyme scheme as highlighted below.

> Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
> 
> 
> In the forests of the night;
> 
> What immortal hand or eye,
> 
> Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
> 
> ….
> 

## Palindromes

A Palidrome is a word which when spelled backwards results in the same word! An anagram on the other hand is word formed from the re-arrangement of letters of another word.

Moreover, there are works that have explored this even further such as War Ends War by Anthony Etherin in which the author employs anagrams and palindromes in two verses.

## Pascal’s triangle!
A rather surprising use of symmetry can be found in Tamil literature where an instance of Pascal's triangle is sketched out. This poem represents the shape of a chariot and the number of words emulate Pascal's triangle!

# Sung poetry

Poetry that is sung typically also displays symmetries which are commonly found in rhyme-schemes. A very explicit example of this can be found in the song “Meat grinder” by MF Doom.

> The worst-hated God who perpetrated odd favours,
Demonstrated in the perforated Rod lavers
In all quad flavours,
Lord save us
>
